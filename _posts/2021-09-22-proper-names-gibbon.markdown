Pt 1:
Here is the link to the spreadsheet I filled out for part 1 - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u0oYlYg2z6DVUdSU0EVnKOUt8gHlBe6TFS72F9x09nU/edit#gid=0

Pt 2:
a)This excerpt is discussing Gibbon's introduction to geography, including some of his main influences. Later in the excerpt, the author discusses Gibbon's amazement with the geographical knowledge that some ancient peoples had. Specifically mentioned were ancient maps that depicted the "peninsula of Africa" (is it mentioning the horn of Africa?), and how some cartographers would fill in empty spaces with monsters. 

b)Many names were mentioned in this excerpt, some of which I've written down here - 
locke
edward wells
Bouganville
Bonamy
jean-baptiste bourguignon
d'Anville
Thomas Jefferson
These people were all mentioned because of their work either as cartographers, or as authors who wrote pieces on geography. 

c)I'm confused what this question is asking, but I'll assume it's asking how we can learn about people from texts in a better way than independently google searching them to find out who they were. I know in some mediums, such as on Kindles, there is a feature that allows you to highlight a word and then quickly see web results for that word. I imagine you could program a solution that allows you to highlight a word in a text, and then immediately have the introductory paragraph to that word on Wikipedia get displayed on screen.

d)I'm not too sure about this part yet, but I believe Gibbon likes to talk about space as it pertains to travel and migration. He was interested in conveying how difficult / time consuming different distances of travel were for ancient peoples, as well as giving context for how big of an undertaking certain expeditions were.
I think that we should care because travel and movement defines the capacity for human and societal interaction.
